                Welcome to Part II of our Pitch Wars wishlist! If you haven’t already, please check out Part I
                on Em’s website for an introduction to Pitch Wars, who we are, and why you should submit to us: <a href="http://emdashliu.com/2021/09/05/pitch-wars-wishlist/" target="_blank" class="text-link">emdashliu.com/2021/09/05/pitch-wars-wishlist/</a>
            </p>
            <p class="bold">What are we looking for?</p>
            <p>We read widely in YA/NA, and are open to most anything in that space: send us your sweeping fantasies,
                your intricate sci-fi worlds, your contemporary thrillers and romances. We have a particular love for
                thoughtfully-crafted worlds, lyrical writing, and anything where the stakes may be large but feel deeply personal.
                <span class="bold">We are solely looking for stories by those underrepresented in publishing, specifically people of color.</span>
            </p>
            <div>Some specific interests (including but not limited to!):</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Anything that takes a critical look at academia & the pressures it enacts on students</li>
                <li>Anything that dives into diaspora feelings. Specifically, we would love SFF that tackles immigration in a fantastical world!</li>
                <li>Mixed media narratives</li>
                <li>Grounded fantasy, Studio Ghibli style</li>
                <li>Anything that centers on a villain protagonist—descent into villainy books are juicy & delicious & we want them</li>
                <li>Retellings that are a fresh new take on old classics, specifically by marginalized authors!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, this is a non-exhaustive list! We can be convinced by almost anything, so if your project doesn’t fit into one of these things, feel free to submit to us anyways! Above all, we’re blown away by voice, atmosphere, and a clear passion from the author! </p>
            <p class="bold">What are some of our favorite books?</p>
            <p>A sampling of our favorite recent reads! But if you have anything that comps to a book here, please send it our way!</p>

            </div>
            <p class="bold">What isn’t the best fit?</p>
            <p>We don’t gravitate towards horror, paranormal, portal fantasy, military SFF, Westerns, or historical fiction.
                Although we love kpop (and would love to be friends if you have a kpop book!), it’s a little too close to
                Em’s current project, so please look elsewhere if that is you. As YA/NA fiction mentors, we aren’t looking
                for nonfiction/memoirs, MG, or adult (though we are interested in crossover books!). Finally, with the
                consideration that only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/11/opinion/culture/diversity-publishing-industry.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">11% of books published in 2018 were written by authors of color</a>,
                we are specifically looking to work with underrepresented writers; please take a look at any of the other
                excellent YA mentors if you do not fall in this category!
            </p>
